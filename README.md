# SSI

This is a demo implementation to SSI (Self Soverign Identity) concept.

I've created a couple of use cases for creating a certificate (Personal Identity Card) and using it login into another domain website (municipal website, or Health related website)
Next step will be to combine information/certificates from 2 sources to get a third one OR prove something.
